# Codewars kata & solutions

## What is Codewars?

Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on kata in the dojo and reach your highest potential.

Their [website](https://www.codewars.com).

## What is this repo about?

Through their kata, I find myself have a weak foundation of Javascript. I want to keep track of my growth line as well as recording some great Javascript practice, so I put every kata encountered here.

## What is the repo's structure?

I want to keep this organized. So I'm going to put each kata in a folder with independent `README.md` and `report.md`. The structure is like:

```
CoffeeScript
Javascript
    |-- Some kata
    |   |
    |   |-- README.md
    |   |-- report.md
    |   |-- solution.js
    |
    |-- Some other kata
    |   |
    |   |-- ...
```
